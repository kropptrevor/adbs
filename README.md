# Anti-differential bounds solver
Used to solve single-bound variable integrals

E.g. solving the integral from -5 to a of (x^2 + 2) equal to 10 for a.

### Usage
The upper bound or lower bound that is being solved for must actually be greater than the lower or less than the upper, respectively.
The formatting used for the integral is that of the calculus package from the dependencies.
